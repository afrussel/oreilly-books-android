It's an android application created by developers for developers who would like to learn more about software or programming using O'Reilly Free Books.

This example was created to support my [talk](https://speakerdeck.com/erikcaffrey/real-world-designing-maintainable-architecture-for-android) on [Droidcon Santo Domingo 2017](http://droidcon.do/).

You can see my another open source project [oreilly-free-books-api](https://github.com/erikcaffrey/api-oreilly-free-books/tree/api-oreilly-free-v1) is a web application project
used to expose [O'Reilly free programming ebooks API](http://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/).
